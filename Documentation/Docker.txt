1) Make Dockerfile
    If any new modules are needed add them on docker file (RUN pip install <module>

2) Build the docker image. You need to do this every time you make changes to source code. (only one build for all containers)
    docker build -t <app> .
    <app> == name of image

3) Run docker image
    docker run -p <5000>:5000 <app>
    <5000> == port that docker listens
    <app> == name of image
