Steps to run:
    Step 1: chmod +x run-compose.sh
    Step 2:
        Case 1: ./run-compose.sh - If you only want to run docker
            -> Only runs "sudo docker-compose up".
            -> Checks if "docker-compose.yml" exists or is not empty.
            -> Run this only if you already built before.
        Case 2: ./run-compose.sh <num_images>(int) - Remakes the "docker-compose.yml"
            Example: ./run-compose.sh 2
            -> This command changes the number of images.
            -> It doesn't build only runs "sudo docker-compose up".
            -> No need to build the image again if you are only changing the "docker-compose.yml" file.
        Case 2: ./run-compose.sh build - Builds the image
            -> The difference with Case 1 is that it also builds the image.
            -> Checks if "docker-compose.yml" exists or is not empty.
            -> Run this if you changed the code in .py files.
        Case 3: ./run-compose.sh <num_images>(int) build
            Example: ./run-compose.sh 2 build
            -> Creates the images and builds.
            -> Run this if "docker-compose.yml" doesn't exists and there is no build.
            -> Or if you wanna change the number of images and you also changed the code in .py files.
